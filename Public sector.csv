1,"A project built for the public, IndiaChain, will transform the functionality of public administration using blockchain for efficient and transparent distribution of government subsidies, streamlined record-keeping, systematic tax monitoring, and regulated supply chain management."
2," The project also has plans to step into the education sector to curb fraudulent degrees and certifications, and seamlessly manage massive amounts of data in the pharmaceuticals and healthcare industry."
3,"the Indian public sector has driven blockchain-based projects with nearly half the Indian states involved. Moreover, the state governments are also ensuring a progressive approach is taken up to impart a conducive framework for startups and niche service providers to participate in these initiatives."
4,"The outlook of countries, including India, to blockchain, is quintessential and will encourage more countries to tap into blockchain’s potential this year."
5," In what comes as the big time for blockchain, India, the second-largest online market in the world, has already embraced blockchain."
6," NITI Aayog, a policy think-tank of the Government of India, co-hosted the biggest blockchain conference in Asia, International Blockchain Congress 2018 with the state governments of Telangana and Goa. Events such as these will definitely lay the groundwork for a blockchain revolution in the country."
7, NITI Aayog is also exploring opportunities to deploy blockchain technology in industries including drug and fertilisers.
8,Indian leaders are also optimistic about a blockchain powered future.
9," In one of his speeches, Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned, “India’s youth can lead a revolutionary movement using Artificial Intelligence and blockchain technologies with value addition.”"
10," In another instance, during a parliament budget session in 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley acknowledged the value of blockchain and assured the government’s commitment to exploring the use of blockchain technology for ushering in the digital economy."
11," India, as the biggest democracy, needs a revolutionary technology to reform major sectors including agriculture, healthcare, financial services, and real estate."
12, The fresh developments in blockchain technology and the outlook of the leaders and bureaucrats on blockchain are in favour of India capitalising on the technology.
13, We are still in the beginning.  But close to a future where we would live a secure and transparent digital world!
14,"When the Coffee Board of India (CBoI) launched a blockchain-based electronic-market platform for farmers on March 28 this year, the response was dull."
15," Only 23 registered, and just 100 tonnes of indias’ 0.32 million tonnes of coffee produced in 2018-19 was sold via the platform. The lukewarm response was probably because the coffee season, which starts from November and lasts till March, was about to end."
16," However, fortune has changed with the season.  By October-end, about 30,000 farmers have registered on the e-market platform."
17,"“There is a huge global market for Indian coffee.  We are pushing farmers to join the platform so that they get better rates for their produce.  Blockchain technology will help in this,” says YB Venkat Reddy, technology officer at CBoI."
18,This is the first time a government agency is using blockchain technology in the country.  Bengaluru-based Eka Software Solutions has developed the web portal and the mobile app (both accessible on the company’s website ekaplus.com) for CBoI.
19,"Farmers, exporters, curers, roasters and international buyers can register on it, and trade.  The registration is complete only after a CBoI official verifies the details of the participants."
20," Once this information is recorded, it cannot be fudged because of the very nature of the blockchain technology."
21,Data of any interaction on a blockchain-based platform is converted into blocks and added to the blockchain with an encrypted code known as a hash.  If the block has to be manipulated then the hash of every subsequent block needs to be manipulated.
22," As the number of blocks keeps increasing, the manipulation becomes more difficult.  For example, the Bitcoin blockchain currently has close to 0.6 million blocks."
23,"Moreover, manipulating the hashes of all these blocks requires enormous computation power which would, in turn, mean spending a lot of resources and money.  This makes fudging data practically impossible."
24,"“Blockchain offers unmatched traceability and increases the transparency, accountability and efficiency of the coffee supply chain,” agrees Shuchi Nijhawan, vice-president, New Business and Global Human Relations, Eka Software Solutions."
25,"If the buyers are assured of the quality of the coffee, which is often decided on the basis of the region it comes from, they are likely to offer better price."
26," Considering that 70 per cent of India’s coffee is exported and 40 per cent of the export is of the six coffee varieties that have a Geographical Indicator tag, the initiative gains all the more importance."
27,"India’s coffee production too has declined by 10 per cent between 2016 and 2018, according to CBoI data, and it is crucial that farmers get a better price for their produce."
28,The other major advantage of the technology is that it removes the need for intermediaries.  Farmers have traditionally sold coffee through agents.
29," Since most farmers do not have storage facilities, they give coffee to agents, sometimes even without receiving payment."
30," Agents contact buyers, draw the sale-purchase contracts and then pay the farmers, after taking a 5-10 per cent cut.  Often agents hire other agents for different services, all of whom get a share in the coffee-trade pie."
31,"“Farmers get less than 5 per cent of the money for every cup of coffee sold,” says Reddy."
32," These layers of agents can be removed through the use of this technology because not only does it connect farmers and buyers, it also provides for drawing the sale-purchase contract."
33," This has become possible through the use of Ethereum, a blockchain-based software that has “smart contract” functionality."
34,A smart contract is a self-enforcing piece of software that enables parties on a network to make an agreement without the need for a legal contract.
35," “The contract captures counter party information, quality and quantity.  The current smart contract has been made future-ready to also include digital certificates and payment gateways in the next phase,” Nijhawan says."
36,CBoI is also training its staff to certify the quality of coffee coming from the farmers to provide certificates which can be uploaded onto the platform.
37,"This will induce faith in the buyers, lead to a greater number of transactions and help in scaling up."
38," CBoI will also involve international coffee curers, whose certificates will have more value, says Reddy. Officials are also going door-to-door to explain the platform to farmers and to get them to register."
39,"However, blockchain is not without shortfalls.  The biggest concern is the use of cryptocurrenies, which too are based on blockchain technolgy but are illegal in India. For this reason, CBoI is not using blockchain for financial transactions, says Reddy."
40," The other issue is building trust among farmers.  Though the response this season has been good, there are 0.35 million coffee growers in the country, who have been selling through agents for decades and need to be won over for the initiative to succeed."
41,"In a serious bid to improve the service delivery, the Maharashtra government has firmed up an ambitious plan to implement blockchain technology in agriculture marketing, supply chain, registration of vehicles and document management system."
42, The Maharashtra Information Technology Directorate will be nodal agency for implementation.
43,"A blockchain is a distributed digital transaction ledger, which allows maintenance of identical copies of data or records on multiple computer systems."
44, The state government has given its approval two days ago and issued notification on use of blockchain technology.  
45,The government has earmarked Rs 10 crore for 2019-20 of which the project implementation committee has approved Rs 4 crore for adoption of blockchain technology.
46,"State information technology department principal secretary SVR Srinivas told DNA, """"The state government is adopting a cutting edge technology to help enhance efficiency in the governance. Already the government has completed its first blockchain pilot in the fields of health, supply chain, documents and SSC certificates. A detailed report has been prepared to go in for extensive use of blockchain technology in various government departments.  A regulatory sandbox, which will be a common framework for adopting blockchain technology, will be prepared in next five to six months. ''"
47,"Srinivas informed that initially the government has plans to use blockchain technology in agriculture marketing, supply chain, registration of vehicles and document management system and later for every department."
48," Another government officer, who did not want to be named, said blockchain information cannot be hacked or tampered with."
49,"Indian Merchants' Chamber immediate past president Raj Nair observed that blockchain technology has an ability to simplify and speed up authentication of important documents like proof of birth, family lineage, people and their rights of ownership once they are recorded.  This is crucial when the existing processes are painful and time consuming. ''"
50,"More than nine months after IndiaChain was conceptualised, the Indian government is set to launch a massive blockchain project that will operate as a platform – similar to the unified payments interface, or UPI, a layer of software that makes it easy to transfer money in real time."
51,"The IndiaChain with its platform characteristics, it is envisaged, will allow both government and private entities to take advantage and build large scalable solutions."
52,"As part of this plan, Niti Aayog, the Indian government’s think tank, is looking at bringing out a blockchain policy paper early next month."
53," The paper – similar to the artificial intelligence discussion paper released last fortnight (see back story here) – will look at the best possible cases of deployment of blockchain in India, according to sources close to the development."
54,"“The AI discussion paper was a priority because the finance minister had announced about it during the budget,” said a Niti Aayog official."
55, “The work on the blockchain paper is in full swing now and hopefully it will be out by the end of the month or beginning of July. ”
56,"(Skip this paragraph if you are familiar with blockchain technology. ) Blockchain is a decentralised, distributed, digital ledger maintained across a network of computers, called nodes.  Think of it as a large record book shared and updated by many people.  No data on the blockchain can be modified without everyone agreeing to the change."
57," Also, the record book is not stored in one place but instead is distributed among the bookkeepers ensuring that there is no single point – as in the case of a centralised database – where the records can be tampered."
58," This makes blockchain virtually unhackable, secure, and, importantly for government use cases, leakage proof.  Cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain technology but this story is not on them."
59,Back to IndiaChain.  FactorDaily had reported earlier that Niti Aayog is working on a proof of concept using blockchain technologies to bust the widespread problem of fake drugs.
60," Alongside, it has also started working on other PoCs of blockchain around land records, agriculture and healthcare. But, none of these is a part of Indiachain, the mother of all blockchain, describes the source quoted above."
61," “Those were PoCs that are in the works to understand the implications of blockchain technology to solve large-scale problems,” he said."
62,"Platform-based approach. Niti Aayog is looking at how the government can build a public goods infrastructure, a second source said.  He used the example of BHIM, a cashless app of the National Payments Corporation of India, or NPCI, which also architected and maintains the UPI."
63," BHIM was built on UPI and was a reference application.  “If the government would’nt have forced people to use BHIM, the adoption wouldn’t have shot up the way it has, today,” he said."
64,"The ambition of replicating UPI-like features on IndiaChain has a sound basis, at least if viewed from the government’s perspective.  The UPI application programming interface, or API, was opened up for other private companies to use and a bunch of payments applications are built on it."
65," WhatsApp is beta-testing payments.  Amazon Pay, Google’s Tez, Paytm, PhonePe, and Reliance Jio are built on UPI."
66,"IndiaChain is being looked at from the same lens – to build an interoperable platform that others can also use.  “Some reference blockchain applications will be built and then other companies can build similar or better applications,” said the first source."
67,"Companies and other government bodies can build “sidechains” in specific areas goes the logic. For example, in the mortgage business, an individual’s credit records can be on a separate blockchain (banking sidechain), which can be linked back to IndiaChain."
68," “Banks can use that information to give loans and track records,” the second source explained.  Also, a collateral, if linked to a smart contract can be easily taken over autonomously in case of a default."
69,A sidechain can be described as a separate blockchain derived and linked to the main blockchain but which can perform a separate function on its own.
70, The original blockchain is usually called the main chain and the additional blockchains derived are called sidechains.
71, The sidechains can function independently of the main chain and data can also be moved back to the original blockchain at time intervals that can be preset.
72,"Similarly, there are use cases in healthcare – e. g. : vaccines and immunisation – that the government thinks blockchain can have a major role to play in.  For this to take off, IndiaChain or its sidechains will need to be built in such a way that hospitals and doctors see value in it and adopt it easily."
73,"“The government can build two-three layers, standardise these data layers, and build adequate consent controls,” the first source said. Once that is done, the APIs can be exposed to private companies with safeguards on the use of data."
74,"The possibilities go much beyond.  For instance, companies can be given tokens as incentives for using blockchain, which can be exchanged for things like tax benefits or subvention."
75," Also, misuse or leakage of subsidies and other incentives can be prevented, if it is on IndiaChain, it is hoped, the first source explained."
76,"Scepticism or lack of confidence?While the IndiaChain-plus-sidechains plan holds promise on paper, it depends on how well the ecosystem adapts to the ambition and the ease of implementation."
77,Look at the promise: it is a well-known fact that most distribution systems in India suffer from pilferage.
78, Who bears the brunt? The lower income strata of society for whom such systems have been put in place.
79,"In its Economic Survey of 2014-15, the Union government estimated that nearly 54% of wheat, 48% of sugar, and 15% of rice to be distributed through the public distribution system (PDS) is lost."
80," With an aim to plug leakages, the current Narendra Modi government is using direct benefit transfer (DBT) that reach the money in the hand of the intended beneficiaries.  But, even so, a NITI Aayog report late last year found loopholes in both PDS and DBT pilots."
