2,Banks in India were quick to realize the opportunities of blockchain for efficient banking operations and are efficiently using the KYC procedures offered by the technology.
3,"SBI leads as the first bank to use KYC and facilitate remittances based on blockchain, followed by banks like Axis, HDFC, ICICI that are implementing blockchain for its KYC and trade finance procedures. Apart from this, the DLT also enables AML, the validation of land records and asset inventory audits."
4,"Employing another use case of Blockchain technology, multinational investment bank JP Morgan has partnered with seven Indian commercial banks and will onboard them on its blockchain platform"
5,"The seven banks including ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Federal Bank of India, Yes Bank will join JP Morgan’s blockchain Interbank Information Network (IIN) which vastly improves the movement of funds and cross border payments. "
6,"As per Analytics India, IIN may use JP morgan’s native cryptocurrency JPM coin to move funds efficiently by exchanging and verifying transactional data in real-time. "
7,"Speaking to ET, Madhav Kalyan, CEO, JPMorgan Chase Bank, India said that the move will “address the challenges banks face in cross-border payments pertaining to friction points caused by multiple hops through the payment chain when further information is required.”"
8,"The banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector are the leader in the adoption of Blockchain Technology in India taking up as much as 60% of the blockchain implementation in the country as per a NASSCOM report. "
9,"YES BANK, India’s 5th largest private sector bank today announced that they have implemented a multi-nodal Blockchain transaction to fully digitize vendor financing for Bajaj Electricals. The implementation has been done on a blockchain-based smart contract written by fintech start-up Cateina Technologies."
10,"YES BANK will also leverage IBM Watson Conversation, a cloud-based cognitive service, to enhance the digital experience of partners, corporate clients and developers collaborating with them on the integrated Blockchain – API Banking platform."
11,"Capitalising on the efficiency and security features of Blockchain, YES BANK has used the Hyperledger Fabric supported by IBM to design a vendor financing solution which allows Bajaj Electricals (anchor client) to digitize the process for discounting and disbursal of funds to its vendors by integrating seamlessly with YES BANK’s systems."
12,The solution will also facilitate an automated debit from Bajaj Electricals’ account by YES BANK. The business logic and rules are captured in a smartcontract (Chain Code) developed by Cateina Technologies. 
13,"The key business advantages and highlights of this blockchain implementation for vendor financing include:The entire process cycle for bill discounting reduces from four days (owing to manual intervention and transit) to almost real-time. Transparency to all parties through blockchain’s shared public ledger. End-to-end digital process eliminating paper trail & manual intervention.The entire transaction history of a particular vendor is recorded and is immutable through blockchain. The transaction status along with details are seamlessly transmitted to Bajaj Electricals’ Enterprise Resource Planning. Seamless integration with existing API Banking implementation by YES BANK using IBM’s Enterprise Service Bus(IIB), API management and Datapower solution. This integration offers automated processing of transactions with almost zero manual intervention. "
14,"YES BANK was the 1st Bank in India to launch API Banking services, which was also in collaboration with IBM in 2015.Use of a permissioned blockchain with flexibility to add other participants later. Use of superior Cryptokey to offer state-of-the-art security for both documents and transactions on the Blockchain."
15,"Speaking on the implementation, Mr. Rana Kapoor, MD&CEO, YES BANK, said,” Since inception, YES BANK has used technology and innovation, as mission critical pillars, to offer a superior banking experience to its corporate and retail customers.

It also enables us and our vendor to track the status of the transactions on real time basis.”  "
18,"YES BANK will also use IBM Watson APIs on IBM Bluemix to drive a pioneering engagement program that will enrich the digital experience of the bank’s partners, developers as well as corporate clients. "
19,"The program is a conversational agent service of IBM Bluemix cloud which uses Watson APIs (Natural Language Classifier & Conversation Agent) to create a natural language interaction with the partners and external developers, when providing support on queries related to  YES BANK banking APIs, the Blockchain APIs, how to subscribe etc. The aim of the system is to help YES Bank’s partners and developers onboard and integrate their system quickly and simply whilst keeping waiting times to a bare minimum. With the conversation agent being able to find answers from the various backend sources in just a split second, the staff will be freed up to handle more complex problems and partners can benefit from a much simpler and faster process."
20,A report by Deloitte identifies ‘trade clearing and settlement’ as one among two use-cases of smart contracts that were most immediate to market. This makes the banking industry a huge potential market for the blockchain.
21,Infosys and TCS are the first large companies to roll out the use of blockchain technology in core banking platforms.
22,"A recent report by the innovation fund of Santander Bank predicted cost-savings of USD 15 to 20 billion by 2022, as a result of blockchain technology reducing financial infrastructure costs. "
23,"Smart contracts add to the ledger functionality of blockchain technology, allowing many kinds of selfexecuting instructions to be programmed into the blockchain. With the blockchain as the single source of truth, requiring no manual verification, smart contracts can automate approval workflows and clearing calculations.18 These processes are cost- and labor-intensive, and are subject to delay and human error"
24,"A core banking system is the back-end data processing application for processing all transactions that have occurred during the day and posting updated data on account balances to the mainframe. Core systems typically include deposit account and CD account processing, loan and credit processing, interfaces to the general ledger and reporting tools"
25,"Several financial institutions, investment funds, and financial infrastructure bodies have taken notice of the potential impact of blockchain technology on clearing and settlement. "
26,"Investors in blockchain startups in the clearing and settlement space include Khosla Ventures, SV Angel, Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Santander."
27,The two consortiums R3 and Enterprise Ethereum Alliance together boast several leading global financial institutions.
28,"The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure organization in global finance, announced a project to deploy blockchain technology for the clearing and settlement of a huge swathe of repurchase agreement (repo) transactions.21 Also, seven major European financial institutions, including BNP Paribas Securities, announced a venture called ‘Liquidshare’ to explore the development of a post-trade blockchain-based infrastructure for small and medium enterprises in Europe."
29,"Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Yes Bank have carried out blockchain pilot runs for vendor financing and international trade finance."
30,"In February 2017, India’s largest bank, State Bank of India, announced a consortium “Bankchain” to implement blockchain technology, which now includes over 30 commercial banks, including most of India’s largest banks."
31,"Bankchain is reported to be working on setting up an integrated corporate e-KYC platform, a vendor rating system and a blockchain powered register, which records hypothecation, lien, mortgages and pledges on movable, immovable and tangible assets."
32,"The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) too had held an “ideathon,” and set up a working group to help it understand the implications of blockchain technology."
33,"In November 2018, HSBC Bank in India settled an export transaction for Reliance Industries Limited using the blockchain.31 The customer in this transaction was based in the U.S. and the transaction involved using a blockchainbased Letter of Credit and an electronic bill-oflading which allowed for a digital transfer in the title of goods."
34,"Additionally, ‘India Trade Connect’ is a consortium led by Infosys which was joined by Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, RBL Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, South Indian Bank, and Yes Bank, to address the trade finance process requirements of banks.32 It is powered by Finacle Trade Connect, a blockchainbased solution for trade finance requirements that digitizes trade finance business processes and offers functionality including bill collection, letters of credit and invoice financing."
35,"Securities In 2015, Nasdaq announced an enterprise-wide initiative to leverage blockchain technology.33 Its first use was to “offer efficient, fully-electronic services that facilitate the issuance, transfer, and management of private company securities.”34 Significantly, in May 2016, it announced the ‘Nasdaq Financial Framework,’ which is an endto-end solution for its financial infrastructure clients around the world, including traditional exchanges.35 The Framework allows clients to leverage blockchain technology, as one of many other capabilities, including machine learning, for their individual needs. Nasdaq was one of the first multinational financial services companies to begin using the blockchain in a non-currency manner."
36," Following in its lead, several other stock and commodity exchanges, including India’s National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, the Japan Exchange Group, the Deutsche Börse, the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, the Australian Securities Exchange, and the Sydney Stock Exchange have been investigating the potential of blockchain technology to varying extents."
37,"In February 2017, the NSE, along with ICICI Bank, IDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank, RBL Bank, HDFC Securities, and Blockchain startup Elemential, recently jointly conducted a Know Your Customer (KYC) data trial using the blockchain."
38,The NSE was also reported to be experimenting with the use of blockchain technology to ensure settlement guarantees.40 Both the NSE and the BSE have in the past hosted blockchain events.
39," Various industry experts have predicted that blockchain technology can lead to more customized financial engineering, “enabling financiers to customize derivatives consisting of individual cash flows to meet precise needs in terms of timing and credit risk.”46 This engineering can be done using the various platforms, solutions, and frameworks discussed above, or through specialized blockchain derivatives players."
40,"It should be noted that the existing legal system in most countries, including India, is set up with a securities regulator and regulated exchanges as the core parties. Hence, a new decentralized technology cannot by itself disrupt this legal model. At least in the near term, it seems likely that trust will continue to be placed in central parties viz. the securities regulator and stock exchanges, unless legal amendments are brought in"
41,Blockchain is a type of DLT which enables a community of users to record transactions in a distributed (without a central repository) and a decentralized (without a central authority) manner. 
42,"The transaction records are visible to all the participants of the blockchain network, while being immutable at the same time. Blockchains rely heavily on cryptographic primitives. "
43,"The tamper-evident and the tamper-resilient nature of blockchains, as well as the participantdependent consensus algorithm for validation of transactions does away the need for a third-party intermediary to validate a transaction, as well the risk of duplication or malicious change in a trail of records. The distributed nature of the ledger ensures that the transaction settlement information is relayed simultaneously with the payment message. "
44,"The consensus system improves the transparency of decisions and trust among all stakeholders. However, the technology is still evolving and needs further pilots and evaluation."
45,"Some of the major fintech applications where blockchain is being deployed are: (i) Cross-border payments: Under the current structure of cross-border payments using SWIFT between two countries, a single cross-border payment has to go through multiple corresponding banks involved in receiving, collating and netting payment messages, which increases the settlement time and the costs associated at every level of payment message transmission. This requires the presence of a trusted third-party. "
46,"A blockchain-based solution to the associated issues with cross-border payments could encompass the following features: (a) Exclusion of intermediaries and direct transaction between parties. (b) Intra-day liquidity need not be ensured with central banks as all stakeholders will hold a copy of balances and transactions of every participant. (c) Encryption will nearly eliminate the possibility of modification of data and will maintain an immutable audit trail. (d) Private or permissioned blockchains, only limited to stakeholders, will address data protection and privacy concerns. (e) Consensus-based validation of transactions will allow for immediate updation of transaction trail. (f) Use of digital tokens resolve the issue of multiple currencies, improves liquidity and capital compliance costs, allows for micro-payments and expedites the payment process, which further eliminates liquidity risks."
47,"As a part of the R3 consortium, 22 banks are experimenting with distributed ledger systems on a global network. This shared infrastructure creates a representation of fiat currencies on a ledger to enable efficient cross-border payments."
48,. Blockchain will allow for distributed and decentralized records. The associated immutability will be useful for permanent traceability of securities records and transactions. 
49,"Securities can be directly issued to all the parties, with automated servicing process. Secure, real-time transaction matching across all nodes can be available, which when settled will be irrevocable. Moreover, the history of payments and transactions maintained on the ledger will enable more transparent supervision for auditory and regulatory authorities. "
50,"The features associate with blockchain can increase visibility into asset status, which can increase transaction transparency, security as well as allow for real time merchant tracking. "
51,"Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are a collection of code and data deployed on a blockchain, which automatically execute a contract once a specified kind of information is provided by the user. Since the code is on blockchain, it is immutable, and can be used as a trusted third party for financial transactions (including but not limited to transfer of funds). An example of web smart 16 R3, “R3 and 22 banks build real-time international payments solution on Corda DLT platform”, 2017, url: "
52,"Banking and Financial Services sector The Financial Services industry is witnessing an increasing number of Blockchain-based use cases that yield the potential to drive operational efficiencies and improve customer experience. There are multiple experiments in “Cross-border remittances”, “Post trade settlements”, “Trade Finance”, and even “Loyalty programs” applications from the financial services giants. "
53,"Blockchain use cases Trade Settlement Faster transfer of securities and payments and reduced trading cost by removing intermediaries Commercial Papers Issuance and Trading Smart contract based issuance and allocation of Commercial paper to investors, settlement of delivery and payments "
54,Digital Identity Near-real time contract management for on-boarding partners/customers using Blockchain based digital identity management Customer Onboarding Improve customer onboarding experience leveraging digital identities over Blockchain
55,"Presently, testing or adoption of blockchain applications is still limited to cryptocurrencies. A successful large scale execution of PoC (Proof of Concept) requires the banks to hire blockchain experts or data scientists which is a costly affair as compared to hiring software developers, making its adoption difficult. Conclusion Change is inevitable but often resisted by all, especially when it is transformational."
56,The Blockchain is at an infancy stage. It is too early to predict its applicability as a mainstream technology. There are still many changes that need to implement to make it full-proof.
57,We cannot ignore the fact that Blockchain is over-hyped which has made people have unrealistic expectations from it.
58,Lack of regulation and compliance are the most prominent challenge in the way of successful adoption of the Blockchain. 
59,"There are still millions of people who are alien to the concept of the internet and digitization, and under such circumstances, making Blockchain a part of mainstream life is a daunting task."
60,Blockchain’s decentralized structure presents unapparelled challenges for both financial institutions looking to adopt this technology and the regulatory organizations in charge of controlling it.
61,"Three major blockchain limitations for banking include the lack of governance, non-scalability, and regulatory compliance risks."
62,"Although the decentralized nature of blockchain is frequently considered as its core advantage, it poses certain limitations for the financial sector. Without a central decision-maker, members participating in a blockchain-powered financial transaction might have misaligned motives, which can become a serious bottleneck."
63,"However, it became apparent that any such system is still vulnerable to lobbyists and traditional majority-based voting mechanisms. This makes the principle unacceptable for most financial institutions."
64,"Due to the fact that blockchain is a distributed system, its cumulative processing power directly depends on the computational power of the devices involved. In comparison to Visa’s 1,700 transactions per second, blockchain can process around 4.6 transactions per second on average. This gap implies a huge challenge for the adoption of blockchain for banking on a global scale."
65,"With the increasing popularity of blockchain, the scalability problem only becomes more apparent. Although a multitude of scaling methods has been proposed, each of them comes with its limitations. One of the most notable ones is known as ‘sharding’. "
66,"The main challenges of sharding are related to security and communication. When a blockchain is split into shards, each behaves as an individual blockchain network. This adds an extra layer of complexity for developers because it requires a special communication protocol."
67,"The other challenge is security. Because of the splitting, the hash power of the blockchain nodes decreases. This makes it much easier for cybercriminals to hack any single shard, which will inevitably lead to a permanent loss of data."
68,"Financial institutions also face a lack of clarity around regulations. At the moment, there are no regulations when it comes to transfers made with cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Until a proper regulatory framework is established, it won’t be possible for financial institutions to use blockchain."
69,"Due to the fact that blockchains don’t have central governance units, it’s difficult to assign responsibility. This alone makes it hard for blockchain technology to comply with the EU legislation."
70,"Due to the fact that blockchains don’t have central governance units, it’s difficult to assign responsibility. This alone makes it hard for blockchain technology to comply with the EU legislation."
71,"Although the aim of both blockchain and the GDPR is to protect data, the enacted legislation may dramatically limit the adoption of blockchain in global banking."
72,"The European Parliament released a study on blockchain and the GDPR, aimed at resolving this conflict. While it mentions plenty of ways to address the ongoing clash of interests, it is more than likely that deep changes to blockchain technology will be required to solve all such concerns."
73,"Despite being successfully adopted in a number of ways across different industries, blockchain is still immature in the context of the financial sector. "
74,Permissionless blockchain systems in particular won’t be able to meet these requirements unless significantly reworked.
75,"Although there are major hurdles on the way, the blockchain-powered banking future is inevitable. "
